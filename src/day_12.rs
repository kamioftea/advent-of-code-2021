//! This is my solution for [Advent of Code - Day 12 - _Passage Pathing_](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/12)
//!
//! Today was graph traversing. The puzzle was to find all the paths to traverse a set of caves, some of which could
//! be visited any number of times (large), and only once-ish (small). I say ish, because part two's extension was
//! that exactly one (1) small cave could be revisited in the path. I've previously struggled with graph
//! representation in Rust, and today was tricky, but I was able to apply the learnings from previous years and get the
//! borrow checker happy pretty quickly. This was a more impressive feat with my original solution that used the
//! string representation and a hash map rather than a vector and mapping the labels to indices.
//!
//! There are two main  structs used in today's solutions. [`Cave`] represents a node in the graph, tracking if it is
//! large or small (or one of the special types start and end), and the other cave(s) linked to that cave.
//! [`parse_input`] takes the puzzle input and converts it into a `Vec<Cave>`, using [`get_index`] to manage the
//! mapping of label -> index. [`Path`] tracks an in progress path using a set of the visited nodes (using a usize
//! as a bitmap), the current position of the head of the path, and (for part two) a flag tracking whether it has used
//! its one-off repeat visit.
//!
//! [`build_paths`] and [`Path::with_cave`] handle the logic for solving both parts. [`build_paths`] taking a flag to
//! control which part it is solving. The strategy is to have a stack of paths to analyse, pop one at a time, append
//! each linked cave to that path in turn using [`Path::with_cave`], and push the valid paths into the completed list
//! if we've appended 'end', otherwise back onto the stack of pending paths - so doing depth first search. Using a
//! queue would give breadth first search, but it's a moot point as we need the exhaustive list of paths anyway.
//!
//! Today was the worst in terms of initial performance. It was taking ~400ms to run both parts, compared to ~100ms
//! to run all of days 1 to 11. My initial implementation was using a `HashSet<&str>` for the visited nodes, and a
//! `HashMap<&str, Cave>` for the cave list. Switching this over to a `usize` bitmap, and `Vec<Cave>` brought it down
//! to ~130ms, better but still slower than the other days combined. The second optimisation was that I had
//! previously been tracking the full path up to that point as a `Vec<usize>` (originally `Vec<&str>`.) Because the
//! paths branch, adding a new cave to a path needs to copy it, so the original is left as is to have the next linked
//! cave appended. This had been useful for debugging, esp. when it was using `&str`s to track the caves, but wasn't
//! actually needed to calculate the solution - the visited set and current position are sufficient. Removing this
//! `Vec` and associated copying brought it down to ~10ms ðŸŽ‰. I was very glad for the unit tests that let me refactor
//! each step with confidence. Getting [`Path::with_cave`] right took a few attempts, and the tests quickly helped me
//! identify where I'd gone wrong.
