//! This is my solution for [Advent of Code - Day 7 - _The Treachery of Whales_](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7)
//!
//! Today's input was a bunch of ðŸ¦€ crabs ðŸ¦€ (in submarines ) who can only move sideways (despite
//! being in submarines ðŸ¤·.) The challenge was to find the most efficient position to align them to,
//! given a particular cost function for a crab submarine to move a certain distance.
//!
//! For part one this was a linear cost, which reduces to finding the median, and calculating the
//! cost for each crab to move to that median. This is implemented by [`find_distance_to_median`].
//! As an informal proof for this method consider: for any given position value, incrementing that
//! position by one increases the overall cost by one per crab below that value, and decreases it by
//! one per crab above that value. Decrementing the position has the opposite effect. For any crab
//! other than the median, if you move the value towards the median, more crabs are on the side that
//! decreases the cost (by definition), and so the overall cost decreases. An interesting note in
//! the case of an even number of crabs, the value of either crab in the middle pair, and any values
//! between them will produce the same optimal cost, so in that case we can just pick one
//! arbitrarily.
//!
//! For part two the cost function was the triangular number of the distance, `1 => 1`, `2 => 3`,
//! `3 => 6`, ... or `(n * (n+1) ) / 2`. This is implemented by [`find_triangular_distance_to_mean`].
//! I have to admit I guessed the mean here. It seems reasonable - if the cost increases as you move
//! further you want a lot of crabs to move the shortest distance they can. Given there was an issue
//! where the rounding was slightly off (rounding the calculated mean worked for the sample, but
//! floor was needed for the puzzle input) I suspect the mean is the limit as the steepness of the
//! cost function increases, and it's close enough (Â±1) for triangular distance. But equally that
//! may just be a weirdness of integer maths. If anyone has information on more concrete theory
//! about this I'd be interested in a link.
